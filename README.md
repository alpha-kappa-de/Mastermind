# MASTERMIND - Game project for university

 This is a little project we are writing for university. It's the game **Mastermind** also known as *SuperHirn*, *Super Code*, *Variablo* and *LogikTrainer*.
 The code is completely written in C according to the C89 standard and it's only using the C89 standard library.

## :building_construction:  Compile the game yourself. (You will need to have gcc installed)
#### Compile it yourself
You can compile the complete game yourself. To make this task easier, you can just use the Compile Script!

#### Compile Script on *Linux* or *MacOS* 
- Download the complete repository.
- Unzip it.
- Open a Terminal window in */Mastermind* and type "*./compile_mastermind.sh*".
- Now there should be a Mastermind.out in */Mastermind*.
- Just open it by typing "*./Mastermind.out*" into the Terminal.

#### Compile Script on *Windows*
- Download the complete repository.
- Unzip it.
- Run the *wincompile_mastermind.bat* inside the *Mastermind* folder (Just doubleclick it). 
- Now there should be a Mastermind.exe in the *Mastermind* folder.
- Open a Terminal window in */Mastermind* and type "*Mastermind.exe*".

## :jigsaw:  Easily expandible

 It's quite easy to add a new language. The GUI will automatically include your added language if you follow these steps.
 1. **mastermind_language.h**
    - Define a new constant like *#define LANGUAGE_SPANISH 3*.
    - Increment the constant *AMOUNT_OF_LANGUAGES*.
 2. **mastermind.c**
    - Add a new case with your language to *language_menu()*.
 3. **mastermind_language.c**
    - Add a new case into every function with your translation.
